ABSTRCT
Consequently, we suggest that RS should provide richer explanations in order to increase their perceived recommendation quality and trustworthiness.

INTRODUCTION


현 추천 시스템의 상황

Even though recommendation algorithms have become highly accurate in terms of estimating a user’s preferences [1, 15], they oftentimes appear as “black boxes” by concealing important details from their users. As a consequence, users create an unfitting mental model of the RS which may result in distrust and ultimately even in rejection of the system’s recommendations [17, 46].

RS are faceless entities lacking the human properties that are important for the development of trust, thus making it difficult for users to form bonds of any kind.

One way to alleviate this, is to introduce social components into RS [6, 26]. There is a growing number of websites where automated and human-generated recommendations are combined—the latter, for example, in form of customer product reviews. For the reasons above, personal recommendation sources, i.e. users providing recommendations, are often associated with a higher trustworthiness [26, 44].

In the same line, designers of RS often strive to increase transparency and trustworthiness by providing textual ex- planatory components for recommendations [5, 46, 50]. A very common technique is to indicate similarity between re- commendations and items the user is currently browsing or has expressed preferences for in the past. A well-known ex- ample for the former is Amazon’s “Users who bought . . . also bought . . . ” explanation. Similar kinds of explanations are applied by, for instance, Netflix and Spotify. Even though the effectiveness of such simplistic approaches utilizing similarity- based explanations has been questioned [5, 12],

a thorough empirical comparison with systems using richer explanations— especially in terms of the perceived trustworthiness and its influential factors—is still missing.
